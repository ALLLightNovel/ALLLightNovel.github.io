# ALLLightNovel.github.io

Welcome to **ALLLightNovel** – an open-source initiative dedicated to indexing, recommending, and showcasing translated and original web novels for a global audience.

This GitHub Pages site serves as our **project hub** and backup index for:
- Featured novels with summaries, ratings, and tags
- Reading lists curated by genre, popularity, and themes
- Contributor tools for translators, editors, and novel lovers

## 🌟 Inspiration and Credit

This project was made possible thanks to the incredible work of [**fictioneer**](https://github.com/Tetrakern/fictioneer) by **Tetrakern**, which inspired our architecture and novel metadata system. We extend our heartfelt thanks to the author and contributors of that project.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Provide a user-friendly index of popular light/web novels.
- Highlight underappreciated translated gems.
- Support the web fiction community through discoverability and open contribution.

## 🚀 Coming Soon

We're actively developing:
- A frontend reader and index powered by GitHub Pages.
